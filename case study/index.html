<h1>IDM 241 Case Study</h1>
<h2>Betty Shin</h2>

<h2>The Overview</h2>
    <p class="p-space">For my final project in IDM 241, I designed and developed a microinteraction inspired by Pinterest's pin card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        Over the span of 11 weeks, the goal was to create an engaging and meaningful interaction with at least five triggers while documenting its triggers, rules, feedback, loops, and modes.</p>
    <p class="p-space">The project centered on improving the usability and delight of the pin card experience. Throughout development, I refined timing for hovers, clicks, and fade effects, and navigated challenges 
        in JavaScript element targeting and interaction flow. These iterations strengthened my understanding of accessible interaction design, thoughtful timing, and clean code structure.</p>
    <p class="p-space">Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that strengthened both my technical and interaction design skills, and a deeper appreciation for crafting purposeful microinteractions.</p>

<h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
    <h3 class="p-c-t-space">Background / Description / Timeline / Purpose</h3>
        <p class="p-c-space">This project was created as my final assignment for IDM 241, an 11-week course focused on building purposeful microinteractions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose was to analyze a real
            digital interaction, deconstruct its components, and rebuild it in a more intentional and engaging way. I worked independently on the entire project, from concept and coding to interaction logic and visual design.</p>
        <p class="p-b-space">I selected Pinterest's pin card as the foundation because it's a familiar interface that many users rely on daily, yet the interaction itself is often taken for granted. Rebuilding it provided a clear 
            opportunity to demonstrate both technical execution and interaction design thinking.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p class="p-c-space">Despite how widely used Pinterest's pin card is, its interaction is fairly simple and can feel emotionally flat. I wanted to address three key issues:</p>
        <div class="li-space-1">
            <li>Unclear timing for visual feedback</li>
            <li>Minimal motion cues that make the interaction feel static</li>
            <li>Little to no emotional engagement beyond the basic function</li>
        </div>
    <p class="p-b-space">The challenge was to rethink these moments and make the interaction more meaningful, delightful, and intuitive while still keeping it fast, efficient, and familiar to users.</p>

<h3>Goals & Objectives</h3>
    <p class="p-c-space">Success for this project was defined by building a microinteraction that was both functional and emotionally engaging. My specific objectives included:</p>
        <div class="li-space-2">
            <li>Creating at least five clear triggers that work together seamlessly</li>
            <li>Building a fully responsive, self-hosted webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
            <li>Designing smooth, intentional timing, transitions, and feedback</li>
            <li>Documenting the full microinteraction system: triggers, rules, feedback, loops, and modes</li>
            <li>Improving the clarity and enjoyment of the pinning action without introducing friction</li>
        </div>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p class="p-c-space">This was a solo project, and I was responsible for the entire interaction design and development process. The focus was on solving interaction challenges, refining motion, 
        timing, and clarity to improve a familiar experience in a meaningful way.</p>

<h2>Process and Insight</h2>
    <img class="process" src="images/process.jpg" alt="process hero">
    <p class="p-space">The project was built out across six phases: Alpha Description, Alpha Build, Beta Description, Beta Build, Final Description, and Final Build. Each phase helped me refine both the interaction and the 
        reasoning behind it along with professor and class critique.</p>
    <p class="p-space">I began by breaking down Pinterest’s pin card into its core microinteraction components: triggers, rules, feedback, loops, and modes. This breakdown gave me a clear idea for what needed 
        improvement and how each part should function.</p>
    <p class="p-space">In the Alpha phases, I focused on experimentation, testing hover states, fade, and timing sequences. These early iterations helped me understand how small experimentation could change the 
        feel and clarity of the interaction.</p>
    <p class="p-space">During the Beta phases, I refined these ideas more cohesive. Exploring more hover interactions, scale and fade easing, and creating shiny glimmer effect with the intended user experience. 
        This is where the interaction began to feel more polished and intentional.</p>
    <p class="p-space">The final build centered on polishing up: making sure all animations had the right timing, improving responsiveness across different screen sizes, and adding click animations that brought the 
        card for functional. This stage brought everything together into a smooth, and fully functioning microinteraction.</p>
    <p class="p-space">Through these iterations, I learned how subtle design and timing decisions shape user perception, and how continuous testing are in creating purposeful microinteractions.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
    <img class="process" src="images/solution.gif" alt="process hero">
    <p class="p-space">The final microinteraction features a redeveloped pin card that includes intentional motion, clear feedback, and a smoother interaction flow. Key elements include hover and click 
        effects across different buttons inside the pin card. An animated pin to checkmark transition, temporary button background color changes, a “Saved to Board” fade in message, 
        confetti burst animation on click, and shiny glimmer text effect. The build is fully coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with refined rules and triggers to support the interaction system.</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>
<p class="p-space">This project is one I’m genuinely proud of and consider a personal success. Through this process, I learned that it’s okay when the final code doesn’t perfectly match the original vision, 
    and what matters is the ability to rethink, adapt, and find solutions that result in something even stronger and more unique.</p>
